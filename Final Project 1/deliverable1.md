### 1. What is a web server?
On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.

On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

### 4. What is virtualbox?
you have a single powerful computer, but you want to run multiple operating systems without needing separate physical machines for each one. That’s where VirtualBox steps in, acting as a bridge that allows you to simulate additional computers within your existing setup. This means you can run Windows on a Mac, or test Linux applications on a Windows machine. It's like having a mini-computer inside your computer, and once you wrap your head around it, the possibilities feel endless.
